# Generative-Pretrained-Transformer

My [blog](https://mohanr.github.io/ToyGPT/) describes the steps I took to port the code.

# Diffusion
I have ported a Diffusion model to TensorFlow. This is a direct conversion from this [notebook](https://gist.github.com/selflein) at this time.
I will update the code as I learn more about Diffusion. Now even though the code executed the sample is not good enough.
